## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep manifold open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## <a name="issue"></a> Issues and Bugs
If you find a bug, you can help us by submitting an [Issue][git-iss] to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a [Pull Request][git-pr] with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Feature Requests

If you want to contribute or add new features, please use [Issue][git-iss] on github projects to start a new discussion. If you receive a go-ahead, you can submit your patch as PR to the repository.

If you are looking for inspiration on feature ideas, we list our planned features in our [roadmap](https://github.com/uber/manifold/wiki/Manifold-one-year-roadmap). We will prioritize our review and support for pull requests related to items on the list.

## <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting Pull Request

* Search [GitHub][git-pr] for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Create the development environment
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
    ```

* Create your patch commit, **including appropriate test cases**.
* If the changes affect public APIs, change or add relevant documentation.
* Run tests and ensure that all tests pass.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message. Adherence to the conventions is required, because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
* All pull requests will be reviewed by [@uber/mlvis](https://github.com/orgs/uber/teams/mlvis) team
